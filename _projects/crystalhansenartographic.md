### Introduction

This project is a preliminary React, HTML and  Bootstrap and PHP-based api platform designed for streamlined photography sessions scheduling and administration. The front end utilizes clean Bootstrap styling coupled with React cdn resources while the back end is powered by a structured custom PHP API.

This website is intended to navigate a site for artistic endeavours like workshops and studios (arteliers), photo galleries to purchase images, or project based engagement with other photographers, artists and creatives to connect with. 

Additional tools include PHPMailer for transactional email handling. Please visit https://crystalhansenartographic.com/react-app/
