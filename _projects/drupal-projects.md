I specialize in crafting powerful content-driven sites with Drupal. From theme and module development to complex migrations and views customization, my Drupal work is backed by a deep understanding of structured content and accessibility best practices.

Key Projects:

Modular Presentation Repository: A system to manage downloadable and embeddable technical presentation files, with star ratings and user feedback.

Email Subscription & Blocks: Custom forms embedded via views and filter-based syntax, seamlessly styled and cached.

Front-end UI Components: Custom theming for carousel sliders, form rendering with Twig, and semantic markup for better SEO.

What sets me apart: Tailored UX with reusable components, clean preprocess functions, and performance-conscious block rendering.
