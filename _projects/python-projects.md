My Python toolkit combines automation, lightweight web frameworks, and modern AI techniques.

Key Projects:

Photography Sales Platform (Flask): A streamlined web app for photographers to upload, manage, and sell image sets, complete with order handling and customer email automation.

Screen Scrapers: Scripts and small apps for extracting structured data from complex, paginated, or JavaScript-rendered sites.

BERT Prompt Tool: A prototype that interfaces with pretrained BERT models for fine-tuned question generation and sentiment analysis — tailored for marketing content or training datasets.

What sets me apart: Flexible codebases, fast iterations, and high usability across small and mid-sized applications.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
