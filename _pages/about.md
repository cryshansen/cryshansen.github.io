Crystal Hansen is a seasoned full-stack software engineer with a robust background in backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and frontend development. With over a decade of professional experience, she has contributed to a wide range of applications across the financial, enterprise, and consumer sectors.

From 2011 to 2019, she worked extensively with Java, Spring, Hibernate, C# and .NET in the financial domain, where she developed high-reliability backend systems and contributed to core platform features requiring precision and scalability. Her work involved integrating business logic with secure transactional flows and adhering to enterprise-level coding standards.

In recent years, she has focused on building modern web applications using Spring Boot, Node.js, and TypeScript, with deployments on AWS EC2. She has independently designed and deployed booking and AI-driven prompt-based applications, demonstrating strong ownership over architecture, API development, and DevOps pipelines. These projects have involved RESTful API design, relational database integration, calendar syncing, and automated communications, built and deployed in live production environments.

She also maintains significant experience in CMS' such as Wordpress, Drupal development, where she has written custom modules using PHP within the Symfony framework, implemented complex views, and managed content-driven systems. Her frontend expertise spans vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, and the beginnings of work with modern frameworks like React, which she is actively pursuing to expand her capabilities in frontend architecture and user experience design.

Fluent in Git, Unix-based environments, and CI/CD workflows, she is comfortable debugging large legacy codebases as well as greenfield development. She has a strong command of modern coding principles, including object-oriented design, dependency injection, and scalable infrastructure patterns. Her work reflects a strong sense of craftsmanship, adherence to best practices, and a growth-oriented mindset.
